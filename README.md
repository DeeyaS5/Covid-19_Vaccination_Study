# Covid-19_Vaccination_Study
The project aimed to explore the adverse reactions caused by the Pfizer vaccine in comparison to the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine which had been recently approved by the TGA in Australia. A dataset from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (US) was utilised to understand which vaccine was more likely to cause a reaction and in doing so assist the general public to decide which vaccine was better suited for them.
